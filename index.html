                <p class="fade-in-text">Verbatoria significantly helps in uncovering the natural talents of individuals. Since 2014, our
                    certified specialists carry out unique neurofeedback evaluations for children, teenagers, and adults
                    based on seven Talent Quotients (TQ). Evaluations are held by age groups which guarantees an
                    individual
                    approach to the assessment rather than a comparison with the standards as in traditional methods. â€”-
